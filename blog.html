    <h1>Welcome to My Cool Blog</h1>
        <p> I'm a computer science student documenting my journey through web development, cybersecurity, and more. 
  This blog is both a learning project and a personal portfolio.</p>
    <h2>About My Cool Blog</h2>
    <p>My Cool Blog - combination of my long-term wish/dream and something that can not only test my 
         technical skills, but also teach me something that I have been trying to learn
         throughout my life - patience and discipline.</p>
